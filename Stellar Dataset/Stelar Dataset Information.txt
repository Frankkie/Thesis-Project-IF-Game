Fields in the database:
proper: 
A common name for the star, such as "Barnard's Star" or "Sirius". I have taken these names primarily from the Hipparcos project's web site, which lists representative names for the 150 brightest stars and many of the 150 closest stars. I have added a few names to this list. Most of the additions are designations from catalogs mostly now forgotten (e.g., Lalande, Groombridge, and Gould ["G."]) except for certain nearby stars which are still best known by these designations.
dist: The star's distance in light years.
con: The standard constellation abbreviation
comp, comp_primary: Identifies a star in a multiple star system. comp = ID of companion star, comp_primary = ID of primary star for this component.
lum: Star's luminosity as a multiple of Solar luminosity.
temp: Star's temperature in Kelvin.
rad: Star's radius as a multiple of Solar radius.
lifetime: Star's estimated maximum lifetime in millions of years.
